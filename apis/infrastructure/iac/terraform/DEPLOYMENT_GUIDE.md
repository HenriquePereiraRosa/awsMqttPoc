# Clean Architecture Terraform Deployment Guide

This guide shows how to deploy services independently, just like your Java microservices.

## 🏗️ **Architecture Overview**

```
terraform/
├── shared/                    # Shared Infrastructure (Like common-domain)
│   └── networking/           # VPC, subnets, security groups
├── services/                 # Independent Services (Like microservices)
│   ├── mqtt/                # MQTT Service
│   ├── kafka/               # Kafka Service
│   └── springboot/          # Spring Boot Service
└── environments/             # Environment Configs (Like profiles)
    ├── dev/
    ├── staging/
    └── prod/
```

## 🚀 **Deployment Workflow**

### **1. Deploy Shared Infrastructure First**
```bash
# Deploy shared networking (like common-domain)
cd shared/networking
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

### **2. Deploy Services Independently**
```bash
# Deploy MQTT service only
cd services/mqtt
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply

# Deploy Kafka service later
cd services/kafka
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply

# Deploy Spring Boot service later
cd services/springboot
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

### **3. Deploy to Different Environments**
```bash
# Deploy to dev
cd environments/dev
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply

# Deploy to staging
cd environments/staging
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply

# Deploy to prod
cd environments/prod
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## 💰 **Cost Management**

### **MQTT Service Only**
- AWS IoT Core: ~$0.50/month
- Shared VPC: Free
- **Total**: ~$0.50/month

### **Add Kafka Service**
- MSK Cluster: ~$15/month
- **Total**: ~$15.50/month

### **Add Spring Boot Service**
- EKS Cluster: ~$73/month
- **Total**: ~$88.50/month

## 🏷️ **Tagging Strategy**

### **Service Tags**
- **Service**: `mqtt`, `kafka`, `springboot`
- **Component**: `mqtt-broker`, `kafka-broker`, `springboot-app`
- **Environment**: `dev`, `staging`, `prod`

### **Shared Infrastructure Tags**
- **Service**: `shared`
- **Component**: `networking`, `security`, `monitoring`
- **Environment**: `dev`, `staging`, `prod`

## 🔧 **Development Workflow**

### **Start with MQTT Service**
```bash
# 1. Deploy shared infrastructure
cd shared/networking
terraform apply

# 2. Deploy MQTT service
cd services/mqtt
terraform apply

# 3. Test MQTT
# Connect to AWS IoT Core endpoint
# Publish/subscribe to topics
```

### **Add Kafka Service Later**
```bash
# 1. Deploy Kafka service
cd services/kafka
terraform apply

# 2. Test Kafka
# Connect to MSK bootstrap brokers
# Create topics and produce/consume messages
```

### **Add Spring Boot Service Later**
```bash
# 1. Deploy Spring Boot service
cd services/springboot
terraform apply

# 2. Deploy applications to EKS
# Use kubectl to deploy your Spring Boot apps
```

## 🚨 **Best Practices**

### **✅ Do's**
- Deploy shared infrastructure first
- Deploy services independently
- Use environment-specific configs
- Tag resources properly
- Monitor costs per service

### **❌ Don'ts**
- Don't deploy everything at once
- Don't couple services
- Don't ignore cost monitoring
- Don't deploy to prod without testing

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **Deploy Shared Infrastructure**: Start with networking
2. **Deploy MQTT Service**: Test MQTT functionality
3. **Add Services Gradually**: Add Kafka, Spring Boot when needed
4. **Environment Management**: Set up dev, staging, prod
5. **Cost Monitoring**: Track costs per service

## 📊 **Monitoring**

### **Cost Analysis**
- Use AWS Cost Explorer
- Filter by `Project = "awsmqttpoc"`
- Filter by `Service` tags
- Set up budget alerts

### **Performance Monitoring**
- CloudWatch dashboards per service
- Custom metrics for each service
- Alerts for cost and performance

This approach gives you the same benefits as your Java microservices: independent deployment, shared infrastructure, and cost optimization! 🎉
